# Weather Map

Weather MAP is a real-time weather application that displays weather conditions for various locations on an interactive map. Each location is marked with a weather-specific marker that provides detailed weather information such as temperature, conditions, and city name. The app allows users to explore live weather data across different regions, offering an intuitive, map-based way to monitor weather patterns globally.
